# darbot-code
Python scripts for the Darbot. These are meant to run on a Raspberry Pi (3) with the spidev python library installed. 

TO DO:
* define robust sensor suite for obstacle avoidance and describe it here
* test sensors
* determine the procedure for obstacle detection using sensor suite
* write a new class for the Darbot that inherits the Robot class, but that incorporates the sensor and obstacle avoidance functionality
